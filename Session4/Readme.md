## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

### Example: 

1. You can find the HR data set in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

2. Example 1 with fashion mnist is classic and can be found in A. Gu√©ron, "Hands-on Machine Learning...", O'Reilly.

3. Example 2 uses the HR-Attrition dataset from last session to see if we can have similar performance.
